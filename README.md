[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/r11ovv4348852ktt?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/GoogleCloudPowerShell/google-cloud-powershell)

This repository contains PowerShell cmdlets for interacting with the Google
Cloud Platform. You can use Cloud Tools for PowerShell to manage your existing
cloud resources or create new ones.

# Installation

You can install Cloud Tools for PowerShell from the PowerShell gallery by running
`Install-Module GoogleCloud`. When you first use the module, you will be prompted
to install the Google Cloud SDK. Select yes and the module will download
and install the SDK.

Alternatively, you can install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-windows)
directly by downloading and installing the installer (the instruction is in the link).
Cloud Tools for PowerShell will be included in the SDK by default.

Cloud Tools for PowerShell uses your Cloud SDK credentials. So if you have not
already, run `gcloud auth login` or `gcloud init` to login.
